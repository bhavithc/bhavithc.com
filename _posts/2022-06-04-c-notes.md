### Inheritance
- It is a relation ship between two classes where one class child inherit from other class parent
### Polymorphism
- Single entity can exist in two different forms 
	- Example: 
		- function overloading - two function exist with same name
		- virtual functions
		- operator overloading 
### Encapsulation 
- Mechanism by which data and functions are packed together into a single unit called class
- It provide data security 
### Abstraction
- Representing the necessary details without including the background details which are not needed for presentation
- Helps in reducing the complexities in understanding the unnecessary details
	- Example: STL

### Access specifiers 
- Public: Data members and member function can be accessed any where in the program 
- Private: Data members and member functions can only be accessed with this object. That is only member function can access data member
- Protected: Can be accessed only by the member function and friends of the class, Also it can be accessed by child member function and friends derived from that class

### Initialization of the variables 
```cpp
int a = 10;
int a(10);
```

### This pointer
```cpp
class Test
{
public:
	// compiler changes to 
	// void display(Test* const this, const std::string& name)
	void display(const std::string& name)
	{
		std::cout << "name is " << name << "\n";
		// compiler changes to
		//std::cout << "name is " << this->name << "\n";
	}
};

int main()
{
	Test t;
	t.display("Bhavith");
	// compiler changes to 
	// display(&t, "Bhavith");

	Test* p = new Test;
	p->display("Bhavith");
	// compiler changes to
	// display(p, "Bhavith")
}

```

### Types of member functions
#### Nested member functions
```cpp
class Test
{
public:
	void setData(int a)
	{
		m_a = a;
		display(); // nested memeber function
	}
	void display()
	{
		std::cout << m_a << "\n";
	}
	int getData()
	{
		display(); // nested member function
		return m_a;
	}
private:
	int m_a;
};
```

#### Overloaded member function
```cpp
class Attitude
{
public:
	void display(void);
	void display(int); // overloaded function
};
```

#### Overloaded member function of two different classes
```cpp
class Attitude1
{
public:
	void display();
};

class Attitude2
{
public:
	void display();
};
```
In above example both `Attitude1` and `Attitude2` has function `display` with same prototype and it is completely valid 

#### Member function with default argument
```cpp
class Test()
{
public:
	int add(int a, int b = 20)
	{
		return a + b;
	}
};

int main()
{
	Test t;
	t.add(1, 2); // return 3
	t.add(1); // return 1 + 20 i.e. 21
}
```
***Note***: default argument should always starts from the right side of the function and cannot come in between or start of the function

#### Inline member function
##### Can define outside the class 
```cpp
class Test
{
public:
	int add (int a, in b);
};
inline int Test::add(int a, int b)
{
	return a + b;
}
```
##### Can define inside the class -> but it is by default inline

```cpp
class Test
{
public:
	int add(int a, int b) // Automatically inline
	{
		return a + b;
	}
}
```

- It is request to the compiler and a command
- It can be added only to a small function
- It pushes argument to the stack, saves various registers etc.

#### Constant member functions
It is kind of a function which denied permission to change the value of the data members
```cpp
class Test
{
public:
	// compiler changes to 
	// void increment(const Test* const this)
	// In above line value is also a constant so we cannot modifies it
	void increment() const
	{
		m_value++; // not allowed
		// compiler
		// this->m_value; // not allowed because it is a const

		// But there is hack we can do i.e.
		((Test*)this)->m_value++;
		// here we are typecasting the const this pointer to non const this pointer and accessing it
	}
private:
	int m_value;
};

int main()
{
	Test t;
	t.increment();
}
```

There are three important concepts which we need to understand
- constant data member
	- Member whose value cannot be changed throughout the execution of the program 
	Key points:
		- In C `const` is a global that means it can be accessed in other file, if we want to make them local then prefix with `static` keyword
		- In C++ `const` is a local variable to that file and it cannot be accessed by any other file so explicit `static` is not required
		- In C++ `const` variables must be initialized during the creation other wise compiler throws error
```cpp
const int SIZE = 25;
int arr[SIZE]; // allowed in C++ not in C
```
- Mutable data member
	- If data member if prefixed with `mutable` key word then const member function can modify such data member
```cpp
class Test
{
public:
	void increment() const
	{
		m_value++; // allowed since m_value is mutable
	}
private:
	mutable int m_value;
};
```
- Static data member
	- It is not owned by any object of a class, but it is essentially a data member of a class
	- There is only one copy of a static data member created for a class which can be accessed by all the object of that class
	- Scope of the static member is within a class, but its lifetime is the entire program
	- Static data member is initialized to zero when it is created, static variables are used to maintain values common to the entire class
	- Static data members does not form a class size. This is because the static data member are created separately and not when the object is created. 

#### Static Member functions
- It is used to access or modify the static members (functions or variables)
- It can be called without using an existing object using scope resolution

```cpp
class Test
{
public:
	static void update()
	{
		m_value = m_value + 10;
	}
private:
	static int m_value;
};

int main()
{
	Test::update(); // No need to create an instance directly we can call it
	return 0;
}
```

### Array of class Objects

```cpp
class Test
{
public:
	void set(int value)
	{
		m_value = value;
	}
	int get() const
	{
		return m_value;
	}
private:
	int m_value;
};

int main()
{
	Test t[2];
	for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
		t[i].set(10);
		std::cout << t[i].get() << "\n";
	}

	Test* p = new Test[2];
	delete[] p; // dont forget to use delete[] not delete

	return 0;
}
```

### Passing objects to functions
#### Passing objects by value
- Here only a copy of the object is passed to a function, changes made to that copy will not reflect into the object which is calling
#### Passing objects by reference
- Here changes made to the object sent via function is reflected in the object which is calling
#### Passing objects by pointer
- Change of the object in the called function will be reflected in the calling function

```cpp
class Test
{
public:
	int a;
	void set(Test t, int value)
	{
		t.a = value;
	}
	
	void set(int value, Test& t)
	{
		t.a = value;
	}
	
	void set(Test* p, int value)
	{
		p->a = value;
	}
};

int main()
{
	Test t;
	t.a = 10;
	t.set(t, 11);
	std::cout << "pass by value " << t.a << "\n";
	t.set(12, t);
	std::cout << "pass by reference " << t.a << "\n";
	t.set(&t, 100);
	std::cout << "pass by pointer " << t.a << "\n";
}
```

### Dynamic memory allocation
```cpp
class Test
{

};

int main()
{
	Test* p = new Test; // allocation 
	if (p) {
		delete p; // deallocation
	}

	// Array
	Test* q = new Test[10]; // allocation of array
	if (q) {
		delete[] q; // deallocation of array
	}
}
```
When ever heap is full then pointer returns `nullptr`. This can be checked using `set_new_handler` function which is declared in `#include <new>` header
Example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <new>
#include <cstdlib>

void my_handler()
{
	std::cout << "Memory exhaused !!!\n";
	exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}

int main()
{
	set_new_handler(my_handler);
	while (1) {
		int* p = new int[1000000];
	}
	return 0;
}
```

### Constructors and Destructors
#### Constructor
- Member function of a class, whose name is same as class name
- Task is to initialize the data member for an object of a class automatically, when an object of the same class is created
- No return type for it
- Can be overloaded 
- Cannot be a virtual function
Types
	- Default constructor
	- Parameterized constructor
		- When parameterized constructer is defined then compiler will not add default constructor we need to create on explicitly 
	- Parameterized dynamic constructor
	- Overloaded constructors
	- Constructors with default value
	- Copy constructors

### Inheritance
- Deriving from existing class **public**ly 
| Base class | Derived class|
| - | -|
|private will  | not be inherited|
|public will be | public|
|protected will be | protected|

- Deriving from the existing class **protected** ly
| Base class | Derived class |
|-|-|
| private will | not be inherited|
|public will be | protected|
|protected will be | protected|
- Deriving from the existing class **private**ly
|Base class | Derived class |
|-|-|
|private will | not be inherited|
|public will be | private|
|protected will be | private|

**Important points ⭐**
	- Constructors are not inherited but can be called from the derived class

![[single-inheritance.svg]]
#### Overriding 
```cpp
struct A
{
    void display()
    {
        std::cout << "Display of A \n";
    }
};

struct B : public A
{
    void display()
    {
        std::cout << "Display of B \n";
    }
};

int main()
{
	A a;
	a.display(); // Display of A because left side is a
	a.B::display(); // compilation error left side parent and it is a
	
	B b;
	b.display(); // Display of B because left side is b
	b.A::display(); // Display of A because scope resolution is used

	A* ap = new A;
	ap->display(); // Display of A becaus left side is A
	ap->B::display(); // compilation error left side is parent and B is not yet created

	B* bp = new B;
	bp->display(); // Display of B because left side of B pointer
	bp->A::display(); // Display of A because scope resolution is used to call parent display 

	A* p = new B;
	p->display(); // Display of A because no virtual function and left side is A pointer
	p->B::display(); // Compilation error because left side pointer is A type
}
```

#### Virtual function and polymorphism 
- Compile time polymorphism
	- function overloading
	- operator overloading
- Run time polymorphism 
	- virtual functions

### How virtual functions work internally
- During ***compile time*** a virtual table (VTBL) is created both for base class and derived class.
- This table contains only the addresses of virtual function in the corresponding class
- Addresses of non virtual functions is not present in VTBL
Example
```cpp
class A
{
public:
	virtual void xyz();
	virtual void pqr();
};
```

- During ***run time***, the VTBL  of the base class contains all the addresses of the functions `xyz()` and `pqr()` as shown below
![[Base A.svg]]
Second, let us consider the **VTBL** of the derived class
```cpp
class B : public A
{
public:
	void pqr();
	virtual void jkl();
};
```
- If the derived class **contains** an overriding function, then the **VTBL** of the derived class contains a new address for the overriding function. 
- If a derived class declares a new virtual functions, its **VTBL** contains the address of the new virtual function. 
- If the derived class does not redefine a certain base class virtual function, then the **VTBL** of the derived class will contain the address of the inherited base class function itself
![[Base B.svg]]
Whenever a virtual function is called, the value of **VPTR** is read first, then the address of the called function is obtained from the **VTBL**

Size of the object of classed with virtual function increases uniformly by **four** or **eight** bytes depends on architecture due to presence of additional pointer.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

#pragma pack(1)
class A
{
public:
    virtual void xyz()
    {
        std::cout << "xyz of A \n";
    }

    virtual void pqr()
    {
        std::cout << "pqr of A\n";
    }
};

#pragma pack(1)
class B : public A
{
public:
    void pqr()
    {
        std::cout << "pqr of B \n";
    }

    void jkl()
    {
        std::cout << "jkl of B\n";
    }
};

int main()
{
    A* ap = new A; // VTBL with VPTR is created for A
    ap->xyz(); // xyz of A
    ap->pqr(); // pqr of A

    B* bp = new B(); // VTBL with VPTR is created for B
    bp->xyz(); // xyz of A
    bp->pqr(); // pqr of B
    bp->jkl(); // jkl of B

    A* p = new B; // VTBL with VPTR is created for B
    p->pqr(); // pqr of B

	return 0;
}
```
Output
```shell
xyz of A 
pqr of A
xyz of A 
pqr of B 
jkl of B
pqr of B 
```
#### Virtual destructor
```cpp
class A
{
public:
	A() 
	{
		std::cout << "A Ctor called \n";
	}
	~A()
	{
		std::cout << "A Dtor called \n";
	}
};

class B : public A
{
public:
	B()
	{
		std::cout << "B Ctor called \n";
	}
	~B()
	{
		std::cout << "B Dtor called \n";
	}
};

int main()
{
	B* bp = new B;
	delete bp; // A Ctor -> B Ctor -> B Dtor -> A Dtor

	A* ap = new A;
	delele ap; // A Ctor -> A Dtor

	A* p = new B;
	delete p; // A Ctor -> B Ctor -> A Dtor

	// Here is the problem there is not B Dctor called it is compile time resolution there we need to put virtual for Dtor then it works
}
```

### Early Binding Vs Late Binding
##### Early Binding (Static Binding)
- compiler binds function call and the appropriate function definition at compile time
	- function overloading
	- operator overloading
##### Late binding (dynamic binding)
- function call and the appropriate function definition is bind at run time this can be achieved by using virtual functions
- There are run time performance overhead

### Operator Overloading
We can overload 
- Unary operators (operating on one operand)
- Binary operators (operating on two operands)
- Special operators (``[]``, `()`, etc)

**Operators that cannot be overloaded**

| operator | symbol|
|-|-|
|1. Scope resolution operator | `::`|
|2. Member selection operator | `.`|
|3. Member selection through pointer to member operator | `.*`|
|4. Conditional operator | `?:`|
|5. size of operator | `sizeof`|
|6. typeid operator | `typeid`|

**Operators that can be overloaded**

|#|Name| symbols|
|-|-|-|
|1 | Binary arithmetic | `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`|
| 2 | Unary Arithmetic | `+`, `-`, `++`,`--`|
|3| Assignment | `=`,`+=`,`*=`, `/=`,`-=`,`%=`,`&=`,`|=`,`^=`|
|4| Bit wise| `&`, `\|`,`!`,`>>`,`<<`,`~`,`^`|
|5|Dereferencing | `->`|
|6| Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation | `new`, `delete`|
|7| Subscript | `[]`|
|8| Function call | `()`|
|9| Logical | `&&`, `||`,`!`|
|10| Relational | `>`,`<`,`==`,`!=`,`<=`,`>=`|
|11|Others| `>>=`,`<<=`|

**Unary operator syntax**
```cpp
<return-type> <class_name>:: operator opr ()
{
	// operator function definition
}
// Example
class Test
{
public:
	void operator - ()
	{
		// `-` is overloaded
	}
	void operator + ()
	{
		// `+` is overloaded
	}
};
```

**Binary operator syntax**
```cpp
<return-type> <class_name>:: operator opr(<argument1>) // only one argument
{
	// function defintion
}
// Example
class Test
{
public:
	void operator + (Test& t)
	{
		// `+` is overloaded
	}

	void operator - (Test& t)
	{
		// `-` is overloaded
	}
};
```

Important overloaded operators which is used frequently 

#### **Overloading `<<` and `>>` operator**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Point
{
public:
    Point(int x, int y) : m_x(x), m_y(y)
    {

    }

    ~Point()
    {
        m_x = 0;
        m_y = 0;
    }

    friend std::ostream& operator << (std::ostream& out, const Point& point)
    {
        out << "x = " << point.m_x << ", y = " << point.m_y;
        return out;
    }

    friend std::istream& operator >> (std::istream& in, Point& point)
    {
        in >> point.m_x >> point.m_y;
        return in;
    }

private:
    int m_x;
    int m_y;
};


int main()
{
    Point p(10, 20);
    std::cin >> p;
    std::cout << p << "\n";
}
```

#### **Overloading `new` and `delete` operator**
**Syntax:**
```cpp
//New
class <class_nam>
{
public:
	void* operator new (size_t)
	{
		// defintion
	}
};

// New array
class <class_name>
{
public:
	void* operator new [](size_t)
	{
		// definition
	}
};

// delete
class <class_name>
{
public:
	void operator delete(void*)
	{
	}
};

// delete array
class <class_name>
{
public:
	void operator delete[] (void*)
	{
	}
};
```
Examples:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Point
{
public:

    void* operator new (size_t size)
    {
        std::cout << "Allocating memory\n";
        void* p = ::operator new(size);
        return p;
    }

    void* operator new [] (size_t size)
    {
        std::cout << "Allocating memory for array\n";
        void* p = ::operator new[](size);
        return p;
    }

    void operator delete (void* p)
    {
        std::cout << "Deleting pointer \n";
        if (p) {
            ::operator delete(p);
        }
    }

    void operator delete [] (void* p)
    {
        std::cout << "Deleting pointer array\n";
        if (p) {
            ::operator delete[](p);
        }
    }

    Point()
    {
        std::cout << "Ctor\n";
    }

    Point(int x, int y) : m_x(x), m_y(y)
    {
        std::cout << "Ctor\n";
    }

    ~Point()
    {
        std::cout << "Dtor\n";
        m_x = 0;
        m_y = 0;
    }

private:
    int m_x;
    int m_y;
};


int main()
{
    Point* p = new Point(10, 20);
    delete p;

    Point* pArr = new Point[2];
    delete[] pArr;
}
```

#### **Overloading `[]` operator**
Example
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Array
{
public:
    Array()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            m_arr[i] = i + 1;
        }
    }
    int operator [](int index)
    {
        std::cout << "Indexing ..\n";
        if (index < 0 || index >= 10) {
            return -1;
        }
        return m_arr[index];
    }
private:
     int m_arr[10];
};

int main()
{
    Array arr;
    std::cout << arr[8] << "\n";
}
```
#### **Overloading `=` operator**
Example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Point
{
public:

     Point(int x, int y) : m_x(x), m_y(y)
     {

     }

     Point(const Point& other)
     {
         std::cout << "Copy ctor invoked\n";
         m_x = other.m_x;
         m_y = other.m_y;
     }

     void operator = (const Point& other)
     {
         std::cout << "= operator invoked\n";
         m_x = other.m_x;
         m_y = other.m_y;
     }

     void print()
     {
         std::cout << "x = " << m_x << ", y = "<< m_y << "\n";
     }

private:
    int m_x;
    int m_y;
};

int main()
{
    Point p1(10, 20);
    Point p2 = p1; // copy ctor
    p2.print();
    Point p3 (p1); // copy ctor
    p3.print();

    Point p4(100, 200);
    p1 = p4; // = operator is called
    p1.print();

    return 0;
}
```
#### **Overloading `()` operator**
Example
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Point
{
public:

     Point(int x, int y) : m_x(x), m_y(y)
     {

     }

     void operator()(int x , int y)
     {
         std::cout << "Paramertized opertor () is called \n";
         m_x = x;
         m_y = y;
         print();
     }

     void operator ()()
     {
        std::cout << "Opertor () is called \n";
        print();
     }

     void print()
     {
         std::cout << "x = " << m_x << ", y = "<< m_y << "\n";
     }

private:
    int m_x;
    int m_y;
};

int main()
{
    Point p(10, 20);
    p();
    p(100, 200);

    return 0;
}
```

### Order of invocation 
If we have 1 child class inherited from two base class then constructor is called on the ***order of inheritance not in order of invocation***
`class Derived : public Base1, public Base2`
```
- Base1 ctor called
- Base2 ctor called
- Derived Ctor called
```
Example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Base1
{
public:
    Base1()
    {
        std::cout << "Base 1 ctor called \n";
    }
};

class Base2
{
public:
    Base2()
    {
        std::cout << "Base 2 ctor called\n";
    }
};

class Derived : public Base2, public Base1
{
public:
    Derived() : Base1(), Base2()
    {
        std::cout << "Derived ctor called \n";
    }
};


int main()
{
    Derived d;
    return 0;
}
```
Output
```shell
Base 2 ctor called
Base 1 ctor called 
Derived ctor called 
```
Event though we invoked `Base1` constructor in `Derived` constructor, Ctor called in order of inheritance

### Order of invocation virtual inheritance
In case of virtual inheritance, ***virtual class constructor will be called first, then order of inheritance***
Example
`class Derived : public Base2, public Base1, virtual public Base3`
```
- Base3 ctor called
- Base2 ctor called
- Base1 ctor called
- Derived ctor called
```
example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Base1
{
public:
    Base1()
    {
        std::cout << "Base 1 ctor called \n";
    }
};

class Base2
{
public:
    Base2()
    {
        std::cout << "Base 2 ctor called\n";
    }
};

class Base3
{
public:
    Base3()
    {
        std::cout << "Base 3 ctor called\n";
    }
};


class Derived : public Base2, public Base1, virtual public Base3
{
public:
    Derived() : Base1(), Base2()
    {
        std::cout << "Derived ctor called \n";
    }
};

int main()
{
    Derived d;
    return 0;
}
```
Output
```shell
Base 3 ctor called
Base 2 ctor called
Base 1 ctor called 
Derived ctor called 
```
### Type conversion
- conversion from basic type to class type
- conversion from class type to basic type
- conversion from one class type to another class type

#### Conversion from basic type to class type
```cpp
#include <iostream>
class Test
{
public:
    Test()
    {

    }
    Test(int value) : m_value(value) // constructor performing conversion
    {
        std::cout << "Parmeterized ctor is invoked \n";
    }
    void display()
    {
        std::cout << "value = " << m_value << "\n";
    }
private:
    int m_value;
};

int main()
{
    Test t;
    t = 10;
    t.display();
    return 0;
}
```
Output
```bash
Parmeterized ctor is invoked 
value = 10
```
Here `t = 10;` compiler try to find `operator =` it did not find anything then it finds the parametrized constructor and which can take `int` so it called that and compiler converts `10` to class type `Test`

#### Conversion from class type to basic type
```cpp
#include <iostream>
class Test
{
public:
    Test(int value) : m_value(value)
    {

    }

    operator int() // this does the conversion
    {
        return m_value;
    }

    void display()
    {
        std::cout << "value = " << m_value << "\n";
    }
private:
    int m_value;
};

int main()
{
    Test t(10);
    int x = t;
    std::cout << "x = " << x << "\n";
    return 0;
}
```
Output
```bash
x = 10
```
There are some rules to be remember when overloading the types
First syntax:
```cpp
opertor type()
{
	return <type value>;
}
```
***Rules:***
	- It must have no arguments
	- It must be a class member function
	- It must not specify a return type but should return a value

#### Conversion from class type to class type
**Using parametrized constructor** 
```cpp
#include <iostream>
class B
{
public:
    int getValue()
    {
        return m_valueOfB;
    }

private:
    int m_valueOfB = 100;
};

class A
{
public:
    A(B& b) // constructor converting the object of other type
    {
        std::cout << "Calling conversion \n";
        m_value = b.getValue();
    }

    A()
    {

    }

    ~A()
    {

    }

    void display()
    {
        std::cout << "value = " << m_value << "\n";
    }
private:
    int m_value = -1;
};

int main()
{
    A a;
    B b;
    a = b; // here it should have called operator = but since it is not there it has choose paramterized ctor
    a.display();
    return 0;
}
```
Output
```bash
Calling conversion 
value = 100
```
**Using type conversion**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
class B
{
public:
    int getValue()
    {
        return m_valueOfB;
    }

private:
    int m_valueOfB = 100;
};

class A
{
public:

    operator B() // contains operator of other class. it is little confusing I know
    {
        B temp;
        m_value = temp.getValue();
        return temp;
    }

    void display()
    {
        std::cout << "value = " << m_value << "\n";
    }
private:
    int m_value = -1;
};

int main()
{
    A a;
    B b;
    b = a;
    a.display();
    return 0;
}

```
Output
```bash
value = 100
```
### explicit 🌟
To avoid basic data type to class data type conversion we have to use explicit and it avoid implicit conversion from basic data type to class data type
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class A
{
public:

    A(int x)
    {
        m_value = x;
    }
    void display()
    {
        std::cout << "value = " << m_value << "\n";
    }
private:
    int m_value = -1;
};

int main()
{
    A a = 10; // implicit conversion
    a.display();
    return 0;
}
```
Output 
```bash
value = 10
```
How can we avoid it. just by adding `explicit` key word to parameterized constructor 
```cpp
explicit A(int x)
{
	m_value = x;
}
```
Compilation output
```bash
C:/Users/bhavi/Documents/learningcpp/main.cpp: In function 'int main()':
C:/Users/bhavi/Documents/learningcpp/main.cpp:21:11: error: conversion from 'int' to non-scalar type 'A' requested

### RUN-TIME TYPE IDENTIFCATION (RTTI)
To identify which derived object the base pointer it pointing to C++ uses **dynamic_cast** and **typeid**
During runtime to identify which type of object the base pointer is pointing we call as Run time type identification 
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <typeinfo>

int main()
{
    int a;
    float b;
    double c;
    long d;

    std::cout << typeid(a).name() << "\n";
    std::cout << typeid(b).name() << "\n";
    std::cout << typeid(c).name() << "\n";
    std::cout << typeid(d).name() << "\n";
}
```
Output
```bash
i // means int
f // means float
d // means double
l // means long
```
Lets check with user defined data type and its derived 
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <typeinfo>

class Parent
{

};

class Derived : public Parent
{

};

int main()
{
    Parent p;
    Derived d;
    std::cout << typeid(p).name() << "\n";
    std::cout << typeid(d).name() << "\n";
}
```
Output - output depends on OS to OS
```bash
6Parent
7Derived
```
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <typeinfo>

class Parent
{
public:
    void display()
    {

    }
};

class Derived : public Parent
{
public:
    void display()
    {

    }
};

int main()
{
    Parent *p = new Derived;
    std::cout << typeid(*p).name() << "\n";
}
```
Output:
```bash
6Parent
```
✨ **Here we can see that, since there is no virtual function in `Parent` class `typeid` is giving as `Parent `since the pointer is of `Parent` type**

Let's see what happen if we add virtual function in Parent
```cpp
virtual void display()
{

}
```
Output:
```bash
7Derived
```
Now you can see we get Derived. That means typeid is used only for polymorphic classes 
Final example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <typeinfo>

class Parent
{
public:
    virtual void display()
    {

    }
};

class Derived : public Parent
{
public:
    void display()
    {

    }
};

int main()
{
    Parent *p = new Parent;
    Derived *d = new Derived;

    if (typeid(*p) != typeid(*d))
    {
        std::cout << "Correct\n";
    } else {
        std::cout << "Wrong\n";
    }

    p = d;
    if (typeid(*p) == typeid(*d))
    {
        std::cout << "Correct\n";
    } else {
        std::cout << "Wrong\n";
    }

}
```
Output
```cpp
Correct
Correct
```
Worked as expected !!!

#### Casting operators
- dynamic_cast operator
- static_cast operator
- reinterpret_cast operator
- const_cast operator 

##### dynamic_cast operator
When ever we want to convert the base pointer to derived pointer then dynamic_cast is used and it return pointer if success otherwise NULL
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <typeinfo>

class Parent
{
public:
    virtual void display()
    {

    }
};

class Derived : public Parent
{
public:
    void display()
    {

    }
};

int main()
{
    Parent* parent; // parent pointer 
    Derived* derived = new Derived; // Derived object

    parent = derived; // parent can point to derived

	// I want to take back my pointer from parent, it's not possible during compile time. Below statement give compilation error
	
    //derived = parent;

	// Use run time casting 
    derived = dynamic_cast<Derived*>(parent);

    if (derived == NULL) {
        std::cout << "Dynamic cast failed\n";
    } else {
        std::cout << "Success\n";
    }

    delete derived;
}
```
Output
```bash
Success
```

##### static_cast operator
it is same as dynamic_cast but does not return any error, If we use it wrong way then it produce undefined behaviour
##### reinterpret_cast operator
It is same as C type casting
```cpp
int i = 6;
int *a = &i;
void* p = a;
int* q ;
q = (int*)p; // C style
q = reinterpret_cast<int*>(p); // C++ style 
```
##### const_cast operator
If we want to change the value of the member variable in const function then we have following options
- Make data member as mutable
- Type cast and remove const -> This is called const cast with syntactical sugar
  
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <typeinfo>

class Test
{
public:
     void increment() const
     {
         // type cast myself
         ((Test*)this)->m_value++;

         //Using const cast
        const_cast<Test*>(this)->m_value++;
     }
    int m_value = 0;
};

int main()
{
    Test t;
    t.increment();
    std::cout << t.m_value << "\n";
}
```
Output
```bash
2
```
### Templates
#### Function templates
```cpp
template<class T>
return_type <function_name> (paremetees of type T)
{
	// function body
}
```
Example
```cpp
#include <iostream>

// example 1
template<class T>
T add(T a, T b)
{
    std::cout << "using example 1 \n";
    return a + b;
}

// example 2
template<class A, class B>
B add(A v1, B v2)
{
    std::cout << "using example 2 \n";
    return v1 + v2;
}

// example 3
template<class T>
T updateBy(T a, int b)
{
    std::cout << "using example 3 \n";
    return a + b;
}

int main()
{
    // example 1
    std::cout << add<int>(10, 20) << "\n";
    std::cout << add<double>(10.1, 20.2) << "\n";

    // example 2
    std::cout << add<int, int>(10, 20) << "\n";
    std::cout << add<int, double>(10, 20.2) << "\n";

    // example 3
    std::cout << updateBy<int>(10, 5) << "\n";
    std::cout << updateBy<float>(0.5, 5) << "\n";
}

```
Output
```bash
using example 1 
30
using example 1 
30.3
using example 2 
30
using example 2 
30.2
using example 3 
15
using example 3 
5.5
```
#### Class Templates
```cpp
template<class T>
class class_name
{
	// class definition		
};
```
Example
```cpp
#include <iostream>

template <class T>
class Add
{
public:
    T add(T a, T b)
    {
        std::cout << "example 1\n";
        return a + b;
    }
};

template <class A, class B>
class Point
{
public:
    B addCordinates(A a, B b)
    {
        std::cout << "example 2\n";
        return a + b;
    }
};

template <class T>
class Update
{
public:
    int updateBy10(T value, int a = 10)
    {
        std::cout << "example 3\n";
        return value + 10;
    }
};

int main()
{
    // example 1
    Add<int>a;
    std::cout << a.add(2, 3) << "\n";

    // example 1
    Add<float>b;
    std::cout << b.add(2.5, 10.0) << "\n";

    // example 2
    Point<int, int> p;
    std::cout << p.addCordinates(10, 20) << "\n";

    // example 2
    Point<int, double> q;
    std::cout << q.addCordinates(10, 20.25) << "\n";


    // example 3
    Update<int> u;
    std::cout << u.updateBy10(20) << "\n";

    Update<double> v;
    std::cout << v.updateBy10(20.35) << "\n";
}
```
### Standard Template Library
There are three important element in STL, they are 
- **Containers:** Containers are template class objects that represent a type of data structure and are used to hold data elements of the **same type**
- **Algorithms:** Algorithms are readily available functions which are used with containers to preform specific operations on the data elements present in the **container**
Example: `count()`, `fill()`, `swap()`, `sort()`, `merge()`, `equal()`
- **Iterators:** An iterator is a **pointer** that points to specific data in the container. it helps in inserting and deleting the data from a container.

Container are classified into 3 types they are 
	- Sequential containers
	- Associative containers
	- Derived containers
There are 10 different containers available in STL, which are distributed among the mentioned categories of containers

| Containers| Description | Header required|
|-|-|-|
|`deque`| This is a **sequence container**. This is a double ended queue| `<deque>`|
|`list`| This is a **sequence container**. This is a linear list | `<list>`|
|`map`| This belongs to **associative container**. It stores key/value pairs in which one key may be associated with two or more values | `<map>`|
|`multimap`| This belongs to **associative container**. It stores key/value pairs in which one key may be associated with two or more values | `<map>`|
|`multiset`| This belongs to **associative container**. This is a set in which each element is not necessarily unique | `<set>`|
|`priority_queue` | This belongs to **derived containers.** This is a priority queue| `<queue>`|
|`queue` | This belongs to **derived containers.** This is an ordinary queue | `<queue>`|
|`set` | This belongs to **associative container**. This is a set in which each element is unique | `<set>`|
|`stack`| This belongs to **derived container**. This is a stack | `<stack>`|
|`vector`| This belongs to **sequential container** This is a dynamic array | `<vector>`|

There are many more added in modern cpp checkout https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/
